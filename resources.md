## Books

### The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy: Second Edition

##### Edited by *Thomas Mautner*
##### Published *December 27 2005* by *Penguin books*
##### Direct Link: [https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/297981/the-penguin- dictionary-of- philosophy-by-thomas-mautner/9780141018409/](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/297981/the-penguin- dictionary-of- philosophy-by-thomas-mautner/9780141018409/)

### Philosophy of Mind: A Guide and Anthology

##### Edited by *John Heil*
##### Published *September 15 2003* by *Oxford University Press*
##### Amazon link: [http://a.co/an3MMV2](http://a.co/an3MMV2)

*This is a rather expensive book but it is 900 pages long and contains some of the most important articles and ideas in the philosophy of mind for the last 2000 years. I do not necessarily recommend buying this book immediately but it is an excellent resource if you wish to further explore the philosophy of mind at a university level.*

### Classics of Philosophy: Third Edition

##### Edited by *Louis Pojman* and *Lewis Vaughn*
##### Published *August 2 2010* by *Oxford University Press*

*Another reasonably expensive book. Nonetheless, it is an exceptional and comprehensive guide to the history of western philosophy. Such anthologies inevitably leave out many important thinkers because there are too many to contain within a single textbook. Nonetheless, this is a great starting point for any student interested in having a general understanding of the major ideas and thinkers in the history of western philosophy.*

## Online Resources:

### The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: 

##### Link: [https://www.iep.utm.edu/](https://www.iep.utm.edu/)

*This one is a bit easier to read and is more introductory but is still sometimes quite technical. Nonetheless, it is full of information about all sorts of philosophical topics and is one of the best philosophy websites out there.*

### The Sandford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

##### Link: [https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html)

*This is an excellent academic resource for studying philosophy. However, it is quite difficult and is aimed at university students, professors and professional philosophers. I again encourage you to try reading some articles on this website if you are interested and never hesitate to go to Wikipedia for a simplified version if you are confused.*

**REMEMBER**: NONE OF THESE ARTICLES OR IDEAS ARE EASY FOR ANYBODY THE FIRST TIME THEY READ IT AND ALL OF THESE TOPICS ARE FAR MORE INTIMIDATING THAN THEY ARE DIFFICULT. FURTHERMORE, YOU DO NOT ALWAYS NEED TO READ EVERY ARTICLE IN ORDER AND IT IS OKAY TO PICK AND CHOOSE THE ONES THAT INTEREST YOU MOST!
